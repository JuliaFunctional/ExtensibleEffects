# Presentation at JuliaCon 2021

The package was presented at JuliaCon 2021.
* find the video [at youtube](TODO)
* find the presentation in this binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JuliaFunctional/ExtensibleEffects.jl/main?filepath=docs%2Fjupyter%2FMonad2.0%2C%20aka%20Algebraic%20Effects%20-%20ExtensibleEffects.jl.ipynb). The binder link provides you with a Jupyter environment where you can actually run julia code and explore the ExtensibleEffects further. The link will autostart into the presentation itself, clicking the big X on the top left will exit the presentation mode and bring you to a standard Jupyter notebook.
