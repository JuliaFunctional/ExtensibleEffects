# Extensible Effects

This package provides an implementation of Extensible Effects. One concrete approach was presented in the paper [Freer Monads, More Extensible Effects](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf) which already has an [Haskell implementation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/freer-effects) as well as a [Scala implementation](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff).

This Julia implementation is massively simplified, and hence can also serves as a good introduction to get to know the details behind Extensible Effects.
